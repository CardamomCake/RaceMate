**This is a third-party app designed to help you create your own custom races for the game Fly Dangerous.**

This app requires you to enable two settings in Fly Dangerous:
1. **Telemetry:** Turn this on under the **Integrations** panel in the **Options** menu. This allows RaceMate to pull your coordinates from the game.
2. **Borderless Window Mode:** Change your game from full screen to borderless window mode. This allows the app to overlay on top of the game. 
It is also recommended that you turn your clipboard history on to minimize your chances of losing your edited race.
You do not need to install the app to use RaceMate; it is a standalone executable. Running the executable will result in two warnings from Windows:
- The first warning is because the application is unsigned.
- The second warning is a firewall warning due to the application attempting to read the telemetry data of Fly Dangerous.
You will only need to agree to these warnings the first time you run the app.


**How to use RaceMate:**
1. **Start the game** and check if you have the required settings enabled (telemetry, borderless window, and clipboard history).
2. **Load a level** that you want to edit or create a race in, and **copy the world data** to your clipboard using the "Copy location to clipboard" setting in the pause menu. (For new races, it is recommended to use free roam game mode as a starting point.)
3. **Launch RaceMate** and click the "Load from clipboard" button to load your level data into RaceMate.
4. **Fly around in the game** and add checkpoints at your ship's location to your race by clicking the "Add checkpoint" button. You can see and edit the coordinates of those checkpoints in the table in RaceMate. (The checkpoints will not show up immediately in the game.)
5. Once you are happy with the checkpoints, convert one of them to the finish line by altering the "Value" of that checkpoint from 1 to 2 in the table in RaceMate.
6. **Load and test your creation** by starting a new "Custom Race" from the main menu and pasting the level data into the field. Copy the level data from RaceMate by clicking the "Copy to clipboard" button.
7. If you are unhappy with the race, continue editing it until you are satisfied.
8. If you are happy with your race, save it to a file to avoid losing it, and share it in the custom races channel in the Fly Dangerous Discord.


**Tips and Tricks:**
- The starting position of your race is the location where you clicked the "Copy location to clipboard" button in the Fly Dangerous pause menu. To edit this location, load your race, go to the desired spot, and click that button again. To save this new location in RaceMate, load it back into RaceMate with the "Copy from clipboard" button.
- For more exciting races, add boosters to your game. These will appear in the same table, labeled "Bst" instead of "ChP." You can edit the length of the boost tunnel under the "Value" tab of the table.
- To make your checkpoints look cleaner, set the pitch and roll of the checkpoints to zero. This will ensure the checkpoints are not tilted.
