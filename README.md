This is a third party app designed help you create your own custom races for the game Fly Dangrous. 

This app requires you to have two settings on in Fly Dangerous. The first is that you have telemetry turned on under the integrations pannel on the options menue, this allows RaceMate to pull your cordinates from the game. The second setting is that you set your game from full screen to boarderless window. This setting will allow the app to overlay on top of the game. It is also recomended that you turn your clipboard history on, to minimise your chanses to lose your eddited race. 

You do not need to install the app in order to use racemate, it is a standalone executable. Running the executable will result in two warnings from Windows. The first is that due to that this applicaiton is unsighned, and the second is a firewall warning due to the applicaiton attempting to read the tellemetry data of FlyDangerous. You'l only need to agree to these warnings the first time you'l run the app. 

How to use RaceMate:
1. Start the game and check if you have the required settings enabled (Tellemetry, boarderless window, and perhaps clipboard history).
2. Load a level that you you want to eddit, or want to create a race in, and copy the worlddata to your clipboard using the "Copy location to clipboard" setting in the pause menu. (for new races it is recomended to use free roam game mode as a starting point)
3. Launch Racemate and click the load from clipboard to add load your level data into Racemate.
4. Now you can fly around in the game, and you can add checkpoints at your ship location to your race by clicking the add checkpoint button. You can see and edit the cordinates of those cordinates from within the table in Racemate. (The checkpoints will not show up emediatly in game.)
5. Once you are happy with the checkpoints one of the checkpoints can be converted to the finish line by altering the "value" of said checkpoint from 1 to 2 in the table in racemate.
6. You can load and try your creation by starting a new "Custom race" from the main and pasting the level data into the field. The level data can be copied from racemate by pushing the "copy to clipboard" button.
7. If you are unhappy with the race you can continue editing the race until you are happy with it. 
8. If you are happy with your race you should save it to a file so you dont lose it, and share it in the custom races channel in the FlyDangerous discord.

Tips and Tricks:
- Starting position of your race is the location of where you clicked the "copy location to clipboard" button from fly dangerous pause menue. to eddit this locaiton you can load your race go to the spot yould like it to be and click that button again. If you want RaceMate to remember that location you need to load that back into racemate with the copy form clipboard buttn again.
- For more spicy races you can also add boosters to your game. These will also show up in the same table, but with the type of Bst instead of ChP. The length of the boost tunnel will be editable under the "Value" tab of the table.
- If you want your checkpoints to look more clean you can set the pitch and roll of the checkpoints to zero. This will make sure that the checkpoints are not tilted.
