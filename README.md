This is a third-party app designed to help you create your own custom races for the game Fly Dangerous.

This app requires you to have two settings enabled in Fly Dangerous. The first is telemetry, which you can turn on under the integrations panel in the options menu. This allows RaceMate to pull your coordinates from the game. The second setting is to change your game from full screen to borderless window mode. This will allow the app to overlay on top of the game. It is also recommended that you turn your clipboard history on to minimize your chances of losing your edited race.

You do not need to install the app in order to use RaceMate; it is a standalone executable. Running the executable will result in two warnings from Windows. The first is due to the application being unsigned, and the second is a firewall warning due to the application attempting to read the telemetry data of Fly Dangerous. You will only need to agree to these warnings the first time you run the app.

**How to use RaceMate:**
1. Start the game and check if you have the required settings enabled (telemetry, borderless window, and perhaps clipboard history).
2. Load a level that you want to edit or create a race in, and copy the world data to your clipboard using the "Copy location to clipboard" setting in the pause menu. (For new races, it is recommended to use free roam game mode as a starting point.)
3. Launch RaceMate and click the "Load from clipboard" button to load your level data into RaceMate.
4. Now you can fly around in the game, and you can add checkpoints at your ship's location to your race by clicking the "Add checkpoint" button. You can see and edit the coordinates of those checkpoints from within the table in RaceMate. (The checkpoints will not show up immediately in the game.)
5. Once you are happy with the checkpoints, one of them can be converted to the finish line by altering the "Value" of said checkpoint from 1 to 2 in the table in RaceMate.
6. You can load and try your creation by starting a new "Custom race" from the main menu and pasting the level data into the field. The level data can be copied from RaceMate by pushing the "Copy to clipboard" button.
7. If you are unhappy with the race, you can continue editing it until you are satisfied.
8. If you are happy with your race, you should save it to a file so you don't lose it and share it in the custom races channel in the Fly Dangerous Discord.

**Tips and Tricks:**
- The starting position of your race is the location where you clicked the "Copy location to clipboard" button in the Fly Dangerous pause menu. To edit this location, you can load your race, go to the spot you'd like it to be, and click that button again. If you want RaceMate to remember that location, you need to load that back into RaceMate with the "Copy from clipboard" button again.
- For more exciting races, you can also add boosters to your game. These will also show up in the same table, but with the type "Bst" instead of "ChP." The length of the boost tunnel will be editable under the "Value" tab of the table.
- If you want your checkpoints to look cleaner, you can set the pitch and roll of the checkpoints to zero. This will ensure that the checkpoints are not tilted.
